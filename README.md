# carbsClassicAddonPack

## Installation
You may install this addon pack through either the UI or the command line, depending on your comfort level.
### UI (Not Recommended)
Click on the green button to the top right that reads "Clone or download"
Download ZIP
Save the zip file to your World of Warcraft Interface folder. By default, that is `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface`.
Unzip the file
Go into the newly created folder and copy the 'AddOns' folder into your Interface folder, where there should already be an 'AddOns' folder.
If prompted, merge the AddOns folders.
If prompted, overwrite any existing files within the folder.

You're done! Launch World of Warcraft. You can follow the Setup instructions below to disable certain addons depending on your playstyle.

### Command Line (Recommended)
If you are familiar with git, pull from git using the following command while inside your Interface folder. Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface` `git clone git@github.com:Carbohydron/carbsClassicAddonPack.git .'

That command will copy the project into the current folder instead of creating a new folder. This will eliminate the need to cut and paste the addons out of the new project folder and into your addons folder.

You're done! Launch World of Warcraft. You can follow the Setup instructions below to disable certain addons depending on your playsty
