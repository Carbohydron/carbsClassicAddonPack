# carbsClassicAddonPack

In order to neatly install this addon pack, pull from git using the command `git clone git@github.com:Carbohydron/carbsClassicAddonPack.git .' inside the Interface folder but outside the addon folder.

That command will copy the project into the current folder instead of creating a new folder. This will eliminate the need to cut and paste the addons out of the new project folder and into your addons folder.
