# carbsClassicAddonPack

## Installation
You may install this addon pack through either the UI or the command line, depending on your comfort level.
### UI
//todo

### Command Line
If you are familiar with git, pull from git using the following command while inside your Interface folder. Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface` `git clone git@github.com:Carbohydron/carbsClassicAddonPack.git .'

That command will copy the project into the current folder instead of creating a new folder. This will eliminate the need to cut and paste the addons out of the new project folder and into your addons folder.

##Setup
In game, you may want to disable certain addons that you do not care for.

Non-healers:
- Disable Healbot
